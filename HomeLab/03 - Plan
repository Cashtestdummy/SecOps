# Home Network Plan

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the steps to create a home network plan starting from the ISP hub to a full mesh network with firewall and managed switches.

## 2. Components Required
- ISP Hub (Modem/Router)
- Firewall Appliance
- Managed Switches
- Ethernet Cables (Cat5e or Cat6)
- Wireless Access Points (optional)
- Network Devices (PCs, Laptops, Smart Devices)

## 3. Network Topology
The network topology will be a full mesh network, ensuring that each device is connected to every other device for redundancy and reliability.

## 4. Steps to Create the Network

### Step 1: Connect ISP Hub
1. Connect the ISP hub to the incoming internet line.
2. Configure the ISP hub with the necessary settings provided by your ISP.

### Step 2: Set Up Firewall
1. Connect the WAN port of the firewall appliance to the LAN port of the ISP hub.
2. Configure the firewall with appropriate security settings, including:
   - Firewall rules
   - NAT (Network Address Translation)
   - VPN (Virtual Private Network) settings (if required)

### Step 3: Connect Managed Switches
1. Connect the LAN port of the firewall appliance to one of the managed switches.
2. Connect additional managed switches in a full mesh topology using Ethernet cables.
3. Configure the managed switches with VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks) if needed.

### Step 4: Connect Network Devices
1. Connect PCs, laptops, and other network devices to the managed switches using Ethernet cables.
2. Optionally, connect wireless access points to the managed switches for Wi-Fi coverage.

### Step 5: Test and Verify
1. Test connectivity between all devices in the network.
2. Verify that the firewall rules are working as expected.
3. Ensure that all devices have internet access and can communicate with each other.

## 5. Conclusion
By following these steps, you can create a robust and secure home network with a full mesh topology, firewall protection, and managed switches for efficient network management.
